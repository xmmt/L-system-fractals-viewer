# L-system fractals viewer
This is a small school project that allows you to display fractals based on L-systems.
More about L-systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system.

You can enter your own rules for drawing fractals in fractals.txt instead of one of the 20 rules.

The code depends on the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) libraries. You have to link __SDL2.lib__ and __SDL2main.lib__ to the project.

# L-system fractals viewer
This is a small school project that allows you to display fractals based on L-systems.
More about L-systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system.

You can enter your own rules for drawing fractals in fractals.txt instead of one of the 20 rules.

The code depends on the SDL2 libraries. You have to link SDL2.lib and SDL2main.lib.
